@interface GTLDeploymentManagerDeployment : GTLObject

// An optional user-provided description of the deployment.
// Remapped to 'descriptionProperty' to avoid NSObject's 'description'.
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *descriptionProperty;

// Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as
// update(), stop(), and cancelPreview() requests. A fingerprint is a randomly
// generated value that must be provided with update(), stop(), and
// cancelPreview() requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures
// optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time.
// The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes
// after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value,
// perform a get() request to a deployment.
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *fingerprint;  // GTLBase64 can encode/decode (probably web-safe format)

// [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
// identifier property maps to 'id' in JSON (to avoid Objective C's 'id').
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *identifier;  // unsignedLongLongValue

// [Output Only] Timestamp when the deployment was created, in RFC3339 text
// format .
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *insertTime;

// Map of labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or
// updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long
// and must conform to the following regular expression:
// [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters
// long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *labels;  // of GTLDeploymentManagerDeploymentLabelEntry

// [Output Only] URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was
// successfully deployed.
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *manifest;

// Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
// The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically,
// the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
// [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a
// lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
// letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *name;

// [Output Only] The Operation that most recently ran, or is currently running,
// on this deployment.
@property (nonatomic, retain) GTLDeploymentManagerOperation *operation;

// [Output Only] Self link for the deployment.
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *selfLink;

// [Input Only] The parameters that define your deployment, including the
// deployment configuration and relevant templates.
@property (nonatomic, retain) GTLDeploymentManagerTargetConfiguration *target;

// [Output Only] If Deployment Manager is currently updating or previewing an
// update to this deployment, the updated configuration appears here.
@property (nonatomic, retain) GTLDeploymentManagerDeploymentUpdate *update;
